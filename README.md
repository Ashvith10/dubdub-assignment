# DubDub Assignment

## About
Uses Python version 3.10. Instead of `requirements.txt` file, this repository makes use of Pipfile and Pipfile.lock generated by `pipenv`. Although not recommended, the `requirements.txt` file can be generated in the following steps:

```
# Enable the pipenv environment, check below to install pipenv
pipenv shell

# Save all modules in a text file
pip freeze > requirements.txt

# Exit the environment
exit
```

## Installation

> Docker file is not available at the moment

> It is recommended to use a package manager to manage Python and PostgreSQL version, like [`asdf`](https://asdf-vm.com/), if the app is to be run natively.

- Before continuing, make sure that local Python version is 3.10 and PostgreSQL version is 15.1
- Clone the repository locally
- Install `pipenv` using `python -m pip install pipenv`
- To install the dependencies, run `pipenv install`
- To run the app, either input `python app.py` or `flask run`. This can be done in two ways:
    - activating the pipenv environment using `pipenv shell`, followed by the command of our choice. This environment can be deactivated by running the `exit` command.
    - running inside the virtual environment using `pipenv run <command>`; e.g. `pipenv run flask run`
